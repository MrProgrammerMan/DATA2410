\section{Task 6 \& 7}

The below is the main code. I would say it works pretty well and is relatively readable and clean. In particular I enjoy the method chaining step, enabled by pure(ish) functions.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small, linenos, frame=single]{python}
input_file_path = input("Enter the input file path: ")
output_file_path = input("Enter the output file path: ")

results = grade_students(process_students(read_students(input_file_path)))

print_report(results)

write_results(output_file_path, results)
\end{minted}
